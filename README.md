# Representation of a Generic Hero

In this project I developed a generic class to represent a hero in an adventure.

## Quick Start

To run this project, follow the simple steps:

1. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your computer.
2. Clone the repository or download the code.
3. Open a terminal and go to project's root folder.
4. Run the command bellow to start the project:

```bash
   node index.js
```

## Concepts Used:

- Variables
- Operators
- Loops
- Decision Structures
- Functions
- Classes and Objects

## Goal:

The hero should have the following attributs:

- Name
- Age
- Type (e.g., warrior, mage, monk, ninja)

Futhermore, there should be a method called **attack** that meets the following requirements:

- Display the message: "The {type} attacked using {attack}."

If mage -> the attack should display **_magic_
If warrior -> the attack should display **_sword_**.
If monk -> the attack should display **_martial arts_**.
If ninja -> the attack should display **_shuriken_.

## Output

At the end, a message should be displayed:

```
The {type} attacked using {attack}.
```
